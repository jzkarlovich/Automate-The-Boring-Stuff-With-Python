# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python

This folder will serve as a place to write notes and store code while reading the book "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python".  I will write my code in Visual Studio and upload it to GitHub while following along with the examples. 

TO DO: 
1. Figure out how to write Python in visual studio. 
2. Create Subsections for each chapter. Notes will be store in .txt files. 
3. Create virtual environments to write code and keep packages seperate from global interpreter. 
4. ~~Is ther a way to auto set .ssh passphrase for git?~~ 
5. Set LaTeX typesetting in Visual Studio and convert .md files (or readme files to LaTeX)
6. Look to add Vim settings to visual studio for writing and editing. 


## Git Commands
Local Git Workflow:

Write Code --> Stage Changes 'git add .' --> Commit Changes 'git commit -m ""' --> Push Change 'git push'


- git clone = copy from host
- git add = track files changes in git
- git commit = save files in git
- git push = upload git files to repo (GitHub)
- git pull = download changes form remote repo to local host


### Testing Section
- [] Trying to set ssh passphrase.  Started 'start-ssh-agent' after 'ssh-add'. Testing...
- [] Test after reboot.
