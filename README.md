# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python

This folder will serve as a place to write notes and store code while reading the book "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python".  I will write my code in Visual Studio and upload it to GitHub while following along with the examples. 

TO DO: 
1. Figure out how to write Python in visual studio. 
2. Create Subsections for each chapter. Notes will be store in .txt files. 
3. Create virtual environments to write code and keep packages seperate from global interpreter.
